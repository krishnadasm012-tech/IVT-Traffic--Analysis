# 📊 IVT Traffic Analysis Project

## 🔎 Overview
This project analyzes **Invalid vs. Valid Traffic (IVT)** across multiple app segments using hourly IDFA-level data. It simulates a real-world fraud detection scenario in digital advertising, focusing on:

- IVT volume comparison
- IDFA-IP and IDFA-UA ratio patterns
- Request frequency per IDFA
- Impression anomalies

The goal is to identify suspicious traffic behavior and showcase BI storytelling through interactive dashboards.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Invalid apps** show significantly higher IVT values (e.g., Invalid 2: 76.53) compared to **valid apps** (e.g., Valid 1: 0.36).
- **IDFA-IP and IDFA-UA ratios** remain close to 1 for valid traffic, but deviate subtly in invalid segments.
- **Request per IDFA** spikes in invalid apps, indicating potential bot-like behavior.
